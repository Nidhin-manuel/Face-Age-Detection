# Face Age Estimation Using Transfer Learning and Semi-Supervised Regression

This project focuses on improving face age prediction accuracy by combining transfer learning and semi-supervised learning techniques. It uses the UTKFace dataset, a large-scale real-world face dataset annotated with age, gender, and ethnicity information.

## üìö Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  To explore whether a **transfer learning-based semi-supervised regression model** can improve face age detection accuracy compared to traditional supervised learning methods.

- **Research Question:**  
  Can leveraging **pseudo-labeling techniques** and **transfer learning models (ResNet-50)** enhance the generalization of age estimation tasks?

- **Dataset:**  
  UTKFace Dataset ([Official Link](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/))  
  - ~24,000 labeled facial images
  - Age range: 0‚Äì116 years
  - Annotations: age, gender, ethnicity

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Filter images using UTKFace naming pattern
   - Resize images to (64x64)
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Data augmentation (flip, rotation, translation)

2. **Baseline Model**
   - Frozen ResNet-50 as feature extractor
   - Regression head to predict age
   - Trained using supervised learning (Baseline MAE: ~14.87 years)

3. **Fine-Tuning**
   - Unfroze top ResNet layers
   - Lowered learning rate (1e-5)
   - Improved model generalization (Fine-tuned MAE: ~13.71 years)

4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**
   - Pseudo-labeled 500 additional samples
   - Retrained model with mixed real + pseudo-labeled data
   - Semi-supervised MAE: ~14.15 years

5. **Evaluation**
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE used
   - Comparison across Baseline, Fine-tuned, and Semi-supervised stages
   - Visualizations: MAE curves, prediction samples, error plots
